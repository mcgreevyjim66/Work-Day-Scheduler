# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description


This project will create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm).This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

During this project I used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. I used javascript to interact with the user, media queries to actively adjust display to different screen sizes, as how make better use of CSS by consolidating redundant classes.
